# RecSys-Note
### Reading notes on the frontier paper at the intersection of adversarial training and recommender systems.
### quick direct
1. adversarial training (by adding adversarial perturbations)
- paper notes on AMF <Title:Adversarial Personalized Ranking for Recommendation>[ðŸŒŸfirst train MF with BPR, and then further optimize it under APR framework]
- 

2. adversarial learning (generative adversarial network -- using a recommender and a discriminator)
- paper notes on APOIR <Title: Adversarial Point-of-Interest Recommendation>[ðŸŒŸgeographical and social influence are also incorporated]
- paper notes on Cascading DQN <Title: Generative Adversarial User Model for Reinforcement Learning Based Recommendation System>[ðŸŒŸUsing the estimated user behavior model Ï† and the corresponding reward function r as the simulation environment, then use reinforcement learning to obtain a recommendation policy.]
- paper notes on DASO <Title: Deep Adversarial Social Recommendation>[ðŸŒŸbidirectional mappings between the user-item interactions (item domain) and user-user connections (social domain)]
- paper notes on ESRF <Title: Enhancing Social Recommendation with Adversarial Graph Convolutional Networks>[ðŸŒŸalternative neighborhood generation, neighborhood denoising, and attention-aware social recommendation]
