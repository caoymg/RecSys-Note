#### **1. Introduction**

- Multimedia content contains rich visually-relevant signal that can reveal user preference, providing opportunities to improve recommender systems that are typically based on collaborative filtering on user behavior data only.
- Emphasize the vulnerability issue of state-of-the-art multimedia recommender systems due to the use of DNNs for feature learning.
- **Adversarial Multimedia Recommendation (AMR)** is  an adversary which adds perturbations on multimedia content with the aim of maximizing the VBPR loss function. 

#### 2. Methods

##### 2.1  Visual Bayesian Personalized Ranking

where the first term p*T*u qi is same as MF to model the collaborative filtering effect, and the second term h*T*u (Eci) models user preference based on the item‚Äôs image. 

- pu (qi ) denotes the ID embedding for user u (item i) 
- hu is u‚Äôs embedding in the image latent space
- ci denotes the visual feature vector for item i (which is extracted by AlexNet)
-  E converts the visual feature vector to latent space.

The difference of this visually-aware recommender model with VBPR is that it **associates each user with one embedding vector pu** only, while in VBPR each user has two embedding vectors pu and hu. This simplification is just to **ensure a fair comparison with the conventional MF** model when the embedding size K is set as a same number (i.e., making the models have the same representation ability).

The perturbed model is formulated as:

- Adversary Construction

  Obtain optimal perturbations by maximizing the BPR loss on training data:

- Model Optimization

  To make the model less sensitive to the adversarial perturbations, in addition to minimize the original BPR loss, we also minimize the adversary‚Äôs objective function.

- Learning Algorithm

  1. Learning Adversarial Perturbations

     Due to the non-linearity of the objective function  and the ùúÄ-constraint in optimization, it is difficult to get the exact solution. As such, we bor

     row the idea from the fast gradient sign method, approximating the objective function by linearizing it around ùõ•; and then, we solve the constrained optimization problem on this approximated linear function.

  2. Learning Model Parameters

     Since the perturbations D are fixed in this step, it becomes a conventional minimization problem and can be approached with gradient descent.

- evaluate the ranking list using **Hit Ratio (HR)** and **Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)**. (*HR* is a recall-based metric, measuring whether the testing item is in the top-K list. While *NDCG* is position-sensitive,which assigns higher score to hits at higher positions.)
