Collabrative filtering (CF): users similiar in behaviors show similar behavior on items,  typically at the whole item / user level.

- Neighborhood-based CF
- Model-based CF 
  - Matrix factorization (MF): predict unknown ratings based on the factorization of the original user-item rating matrix by mapping the 1-hot vector of each user and item as an embedding vector and conducting inner product between them.
  - Latent Factor Models (LF): map both users and items to a joint lowdimensional latent space where the user-item preference score is estimated by vector inner product.
  - hybrid approaches that incorporate the context and content of multimedia items with the CF model for recommendation.

Factorization machines (FM): 特征交叉的权重我还没有加扰动！wow！
