##### Factorization Meets the Neighborhood: a Multifaceted Collaborative Filtering Model

## 1 **Preliminaries**
#### 1.1 Baseline estimates

A baseline estimate for an unknown rating *r ui* is denoted by ***b ui*** and accounts for the user and item effects

- *bu* indicate the observed deviations of user *u*, from the average.
-  *bi* indicate the observed deviations of item *i*, from the average.

 In order to estimate *bu* and *bi* one can solve the least squares problem,  the first term strives to find *bu*‚Äôs and *bi*‚Äôs that **fit the given ratings**. The **regularizing term** avoids overfitting by **penalizing the magnitudes of the parameters** :

üü© In order to establish recommendations, CF systems need to compare fundamentally different objects: items against users. There are two primary approaches to facilitate such a comparison, which constitute the two main disciplines of CF: *the neighborhood approach* and *latent factor models*.

#### 1.2 Neighborhood models

- these methods transform users to the item space by viewing them as baskets of rated items. 
- Neighborhood models are most effective at detecting very localized relationships. They rely on a few signifificant neighborhood relations, often **ignoring the vast majority of ratings by a user**.

Central to most item-oriented approaches is a similarity measure between items. Frequently, it is based on the **Pearson correlation coeffificient, *œÅij*** ‚ùìüí¨, which measures the tendency of users to rate items *i* and *j* similarly. An appropriate similarity measure, denoted by ***sij*** , would be a shrunk correlation coefficient:

- *nij* denotes the number of users that rated both *i* and *j*. 
- A typical value for *Œª*2 is 100.

**Our goal is to predict *rui* **‚Äì the unobserved rating by user *u* for item *i*. Using the similarity measure, we identify the *k* items rated by *u*, which are most similar to *i*. **This set of *k* neighbors is denoted by S*k*(*i*; *u*)**. The predicted value of *rui* is taken as a **weighted average** of the ratings **of neighboring items**, while adjusting for user and item effects through the baseline estimates:

- these methods are not justified by a formal model.

- also questioned the suitability of a similarity measure that isolates the relations between two items, without analyzing the interactions within the full set of neighbors. 
- the fact that interpolation weights in (3) sum to one forces the method to fully rely on the neighbors even in cases where neighborhood information is absent 

a more accurate neighborhood model, which overcomes these difficulties, need to compute the ***interpolation weights*** Œ∏u*ij* (estimating all inner products between item ratings):

#### Latent factor models
- explain ratings by characterizing both products and users on factors automatically inferred from user feedback.

- Latent factor models are generally effective at estimating overall structure that relates simultaneously to most or all items. However, these models are **poor at detecting strong associations among a small set of closely related items**, precisely where neighborhood models do best.

-  typical model 

  - The prediction is done by taking an inner product, i.e.<img src="https://img.imgdb.cn/item/604989075aedab222cca8717.png" width="30%" height="30%" />
    - each user *u* with a user factors vector ***p****u* *‚àà* R*f* 
    - each item *i* with an item-factors vector ***q****i* *‚àà* R*f* 
  - model directly only the observed ratings‚ùìüí¨, while avoiding overfitting through an adequate regularized model<img src="https://img.imgdb.cn/item/604989555aedab222ccabc92.png" width="80%" height="80%" />

-  NSVD model

  - avoids explicitly parameterizing each user, but rather models users based on the items that they rated. This way, each item *i* is associated with two factor vectors ***q****i* and ***x****i*. The representation of a user *u* is through the sum:<img src="https://img.imgdb.cn/item/6049ddef5aedab222cf99881.png" width="40%" height="40%" />

  -  so ***r****ui* is predicted as 

    <img src="https://img.imgdb.cn/item/6049e9855aedab222c01926f.png" width="50%" height="50%" />

    - R(*u*) is the set of items rated by user *u*.
