#### 1.1 The Pair-wise Interaction layer ( the same with NFM)

each interacted vector is the element-wise product of two distinct vectors to encode their interaction.

-  ‚äô denotes the element-wise product of two vectors

-  set of non-zero features in the feature vector **x** be *X* , and the output of the embedding layer be *E* = { **v** *i* **x** *i* }, *i*‚ààX . 

#### 1.2  The Attention-based Pooling layer

employ the attention mechanism on feature interactions by performing a weighted sum on the interacted vectors.

 *aij* is the attention score for feature interaction *w*ÀÜ*ij* , which can be interpreted as the importance of *w*ÀÜ*ij* in predicting the target. 

 To estimate *aij*:

- learn it by minimizing the prediction loss‚ùå  for features that have never co-occurred in the training data, the attention scores of their interactions cannot be estimated.
- parameterize the attention score with a multi-layer perceptron (*attention network*) ‚úÖ
  - The input to the attention network is the interacted vector of two features, which encodes their interaction information in the embedding space.
  - *t* denotes the hidden layer size of the attention network (*attention factor*).
  -  The attention scores are normalized through the softmax function.
