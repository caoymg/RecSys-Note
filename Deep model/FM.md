## 1. The NFM model

#### 1.1 Input & Output

Similar to factorization machine, NFM is a general machine learner working with any real valued feature vector. Given a sparse vector **x** âˆˆ R*n* as input, where a feature value *x* *i* = 0 means the *i*-th feature does not exist in the instance, NFM estimates the target as:

-  fiÂ€rst and second terms are the linear regression part similar to that for FM, which models **global bias of data** and **weight of features**. ÂŒ
- third term is the core component of NFM for modelling feature interactions, which is a **multi-layered feed forward neural network** as shown in Figure 2.
